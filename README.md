# N8N-Repo
🧩 n8n Automation Workflows
Welcome to my collection of automation workflows built using n8n — an extendable workflow automation tool that helps connect APIs and automate repetitive tasks with ease.

This repository includes various n8n workflows designed to streamline tasks like data syncing, lead management, email automation, social media tasks, and more. Whether you're exploring automation or looking for ready-to-use templates, you'll find useful examples here.

🚀 What's Inside?
📬 Email Automation: Triggered workflows for sending replies, managing inboxes, and auto-forwarding.

📊 Lead Management: Capture, organize, and update leads automatically from different sources.

🔄 Third-party Integrations: Workflows integrating tools like Google Sheets, Telegram, Slack, Notion, etc.

⚙️ Utility Flows: Custom tasks such as scheduled reminders, form parsing, file renaming, and more.

📁 Structure
Each workflow is stored as a separate .json file that can be imported directly into your n8n instance using the "Import Workflow" feature.

Feel free to customize the bullet points above based on what automations you've actually added so far. I can also help you write usage instructions or add badges if you like. Would you like to add a “How to Use” section too?
